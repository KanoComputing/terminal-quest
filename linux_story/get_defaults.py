# Get filesystem information for the specified challenge/step

# All the files needed for the system are in a directory, each with a unique
# name. The defaults are stored in a yaml like below.

# Mum:
#    challenges:
#        - challenge: 1
#          step: 1
#          path: "~/my-house/kitchen"

#        - challenge: 8
#          step: 1
#          exists: False

# note_greenhouse:
#   name: "note"
#   challenges:
#       - challenge: 1
#         challenge: 3
#         path: "~/my-house/garden/greenhouse"

# We take only the relevent challenge, which can then be
# processed by the StoryFileTree class.
